This is Beverly's first stab at mobile development, other than the Apple Developer Hello World tutorial. 

Start with the ToDo app from SLUGFEST, and make it do neat things. 

Some ideas: 
-Veganify will help you veganize your recipes. 
-Veganify will give you vegan alternatives to what you're about to eat (gives options with equivalent nutrients) 
-Use a nutrition API to get information to display. 

Realistic goals: 
-Display images 
-Hard code a list of vegan alternatives or veganized items
